# NLP_Project


Our objective through this project is to build a bot that automatically hides/ deletes the negative Twitter comments specific to a tweet of a user. We perform sentiment analysis on Twitter comments, classifying them as positive, neutral, and negative and hiding the negative tweet comments using Twitter API.
